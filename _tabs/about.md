Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Hendra Manudinata**. This blog is a collection of things that I find interesting, with some ramblings about my other passions/interests strewn about.

I'm also known as **@manoedinata** on the Internet. _manoedinata_ is actually my last name, but intentionally converted into Indonesian's EYD (_Ejaan Yang Disempurnakan_, which translates to _Enhanced Spelling System_). Don't call me IRL with that username!

I tinker with Android, Linux, and a little bit of IoT & microcontrollers, but now I mostly work on web applications. Most of my projects are made FOSS and can be found here:

* <https://github.com/manoedinata>
* <https://gitlab.com/manoedinata>

I can be reached in the following places:

* Telegram: [@manoedinata](https://t.me/manoedinata)
* Matrix: @manoedinata:matrix.org
